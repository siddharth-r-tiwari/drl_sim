# Diversifying Parameters in Reinforcement Learning (Distributional RL)
Package designed to simulate the expected shape of an agent using a distributional TD-$\lambda$ learning scheme, an algorithm thought to be encoded by dopamine neurons in the striatum (when learning). The following functionality is included to model experiments and agents:
- Task contigencies (number and timing of cues, reward sizes and delays, etc.)
- Diversity of parameters in TD error computation ($\alpha$, $\gamma$, $\lambda$)
- Associated visualizations (learning/value at time of cue over trials, animations, etc.)
- Saving simulation data/visualizations through function parameters

Change the objects/functions as needed, particularly in the `drl.py` file!
